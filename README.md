# Simon Game

## Overview
The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must replicate a sequence of colors generated by the system.
The game starts with a single color, and with each level, the sequence grows longer. Players need to correctly repeat 
the sequence to advance to the next level. If the player makes a mistake, the game displays "GAME OVER" and resets.

## Features

- **Start Game:** Begins when a key is pressed.
- **Color Sequence:** The system generates a random sequence of colors.
- **User Interaction:** Players click on colored buttons to replicate the sequence.
- **Game Over:** Displays "GAME OVER" if the player clicks the wrong color and resets the game.
- **Sound Effects:** Includes sounds for each color and an error sound.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the game.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic and interactions.
- `sounds/`: Directory with audio files for color sounds and the game-over sound.

## How to Play

2. Observe the sequence of colors flashed by the system.
3. Click on the buttons to replicate the sequence.
